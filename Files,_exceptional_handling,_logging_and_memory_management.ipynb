        "Q1. What is difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages: Code is executed line by line at runtime, without prior conversion to machine code.\n",
        "Example: Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "Compiled languages: Code is translated into machine code before execution, leading to faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Python uses try, except, finally, and raise to manage runtime errors gracefully, preventing crashes and enabling smooth execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is Purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Regardless of whether an exception occurs, the finally block ensures certain code (like closing files or releasing resources) always runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is Logging in Python?\n",
        "  - The logging module records events, errors, and debugging information. It provides multiple log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is Python’s destructor, automatically called when an object is deleted. It’s useful for cleanup actions, like closing a database connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "import module loads the entire module.\n",
        "from module import function loads specific functions/classes, optimizing memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "You can:\n",
        "Use separate except blocks.\n",
        "Handle multiple exceptions in one block using (except (TypeError, ValueError) as e).\n",
        "Use a generic except Exception: to catch all exceptions (use carefully).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "The with statement automatically closes a file after execution, preventing memory leaks:\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
        "    content = f.read()\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Multithreading: Runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory (best for I/O-bound tasks).\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Uses separate processes with independent memory (better for CPU-intensive tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Debugging without print statements.\n",
        "Systematic error tracking.\n",
        "Monitors application behavior over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Python uses automatic memory management, meaning it allocates and deallocates memory dynamically. It relies on garbage collection and reference counting to free unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "1.\tUse a try block to write code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "2.\tUse an except block to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
        "3.\tOptionally, use a finally block to execute cleanup code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient use of system resources. It helps in handling large datasets and long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "try: Contains code that may trigger an exception.\n",
        "except: Handles specific or generic exceptions to prevent program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Python uses automatic garbage collection, primarily through:\n",
        "Reference counting: Objects with zero references are deleted.\n",
        "Generational garbage collection: Objects are classified into generations for efficient cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "The else block executes only if no exceptions occur, making code flow more predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "Python's logging module has these levels:\n",
        "DEBUG - Detailed information for debugging.\n",
        "INFO - General application flow.\n",
        "WARNING - Non-critical issues.\n",
        "ERROR - Serious errors.\n",
        "CRITICAL - Severe errors causing program failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "os.fork(): Creates a child process by copying the current process (only available on Unix-like systems).\n",
        "multiprocessing: A cross-platform module that manages independent processes, better suited for parallel execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Closing files releases system resources, prevents memory leaks, and ensures data is properly written before closing.\n",

        "Q20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "file.read(): Reads the entire file content.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
